# Arena_Petrol_simulation
ARENA 16.1
In the project repository i have uploaded my desired model for the task to increase the less driveaways and waiting time of customers, either increasing a petrol pump or additing a additonal till counter.

This file is saved in private repository after "July 01 2022 Mid day 12:00 PM" This project will be public.


This simulation model has 3 working petrol pumps and 2 tills, compared to base model this 3-2 combination gives the organization less waiting time at pump compared to the base model.
